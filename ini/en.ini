Technologies3=Raising inexpensive frame houses when creating a roof for trusses uses horizontal and vertical rafters, fastened together by galvanized metal plates. When installing the roof, the price depends " on " the materials used, the cross-section of all the reference connections is calculated individually, based " on " the length of the span that is overlapped.
